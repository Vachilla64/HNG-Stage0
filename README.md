## HNG Stage 0: Accessible Profile Card

This project is a submission for the **HNG Internship Stage 0 Frontend Task**. It features a fully responsive, accessible, and testable personal profile card built using only **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, adhering to modern web standards.

### Features

-   **Semantic HTML**: The structure utilizes semantic tags (`<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.) for improved **accessibility** and Search Engine Optimization (**SEO**).
-   **Testable Elements**: Every required element includes a **`data-testid`** attribute for automated testing, as specified in the task requirements.
-   **Fully Responsive**: The layout is **mobile-first** and adapts cleanly to tablet and desktop screen sizes using modern CSS techniques (**Flexbox** and **Grid**).
-   **Dynamic Content**: The current **UTC time** in milliseconds is displayed and dynamically updated every second using vanilla JavaScript.
-   **Accessibility Focus**: All interactive elements are **keyboard-focusable** with clear focus indicators, and images include descriptive **`alt`** text.
